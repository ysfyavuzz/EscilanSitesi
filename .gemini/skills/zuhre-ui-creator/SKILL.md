# Zühre Planet UI Creator

## 🎨 Design DNA
- **Theme:** Dark Space / Glassmorphism. Use 'midnight-blue' and 'stellar-gold' accents.
- **Components:** Always use base components from src/components/ui.
- **3D Performance:** Keep 3D assets lightweight. Use Suspense for Three.js components.

## ✨ Interactive Standards
- **Framer Motion:** Use consistent easing for page transitions and card hovers.
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first approach is mandatory due to PWA nature.
